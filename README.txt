A simple project which demonstrates some basics of Groovy's dynamic dispatch.

The test at src/test/groovy/demo/ExpandoLiteTests.groovy describes some of the
relevant behavior.  The implementations being tested there are at
src/main/groovy/demo/GroovyExpandoLite.groovy and
src/main/java/demo/JavaExpandoLite.java.

To run the tests:

./gradlew test
